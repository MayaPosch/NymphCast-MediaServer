> 1.1. Rescan shared media

- When content is changed within the shared folders (files/folders added or changed), rescan.
- This can be done in two ways:
	1. Trigger manually in the web UI.
	2. When a change in a watched (top) folder is detected.
- Tracking of shared media list revision:
	- A client can have an outdated list.
	- Clients send both the numeric file ID and the filename.
	- The filename is used for validation & fallback if the list is outdated.
